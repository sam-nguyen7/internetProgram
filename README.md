Internet Program

Something about me: I am from Vietnam. I was, however, born in Hong Kong because my parents met there at a refugee camp.
                    I was a missionary kid for as long as I could remember. My family moved to the Philippines to serve God
                    when I was in 6th grade. I have been crazy blessed to be where I am today. 
Past Experience: I did not take any courses in computer science until I came to college. But I've been very passionate in
                 learning about computer algorithms and design. I worked on the 360.gordon.edu mostly on the front end with
                 Javascript with Ember framework. I also learned the Gordon local database as well as the 25live calendar API
                 for the back end.
Current Experience: I am working on a few small projects right now for myself as well as for someone else. I am also teaching
                    myself about unity and game development for fun. For my main job, I work at the Center for Technology
                    Services at Gordon College as their student technician.
Purpose of repository: To show the progress I will have with the project in my Internet Programming class. This repository 
                       will have the final product which I will share with everyone about the work I've done with Javascript 
                       among other skills I will use to make a website.
