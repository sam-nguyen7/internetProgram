CPS353 Week 4 Code from Lecture

========================
This folder contains the code created during lecture 4.


Getting Started
---------------
Be sure you're running the recommended node version, which is 6.3.0
nvm use 6.3.0 (assuming you have installed node version manager)

To build:

```
npm install
npm run tsc:w
```

I am using Visual studio to run the server. File > Open > Web site and select the Week4LectureCode folder
then clt-F5 to run. You can also use Visual Code.
